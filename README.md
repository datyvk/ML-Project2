1. Download the github repository :https://github.com/datyvk/ML-Project2
2. open the folder ABAGAIL-master with intellij as a project
3. Part one
	1. Open Assignment two, and run the program with command arguments
		a. RHC: hidden layers, iterations, RHC
		b. ga: hidden layers, iterations, ga, population, mating rate, mutation rate
		c. sa: hidden layers, iteractions, sa, temperature, cooling rate
	It will then print into the command line and excel file the training and testing errors of each iteration and list the runtimes and overall accuracy

	Part two
	1. open either knapsacktest.java, flipfloptest.java or travelingsalesmantest.java, and run them as is, it will print to an excel each of the algorithm's fitness function at 100 iterations invertals into an excel sheet, and in command line it will print their runtime and fitness evaluation in order of RHC, SA, GA and MIMIC
